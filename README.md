Click the emerald to Begin the game/Click the Redstone to Stop the game

Use the red, yellow, and blue dyes to open the inventories of the corresponding armor stands.

Armor will start spawining in your inventory and it is your job to put the matching armor sets into the same color inventories. Every armor piece will show up at least once but you need to move quick.
If your inventory fills up you will lose a life.
If you put the wrong armor piece into an inventory you lose a life.
45 armor pieces will spawn, if you do not complete the round before the 46th tries to spawn you lose a life.

Each round gets faster so see how far you can go!
